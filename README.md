##   Migrating OpenVAS: From Docker Containers to a New Host

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, the ability to migrate applications and services seamlessly across different environments is a skill that's more valuable than ever. I recently encountered a challenge that demanded just that: moving an OpenVAS installation from an Azure deployed Docker container to a new host with restrictive firewall settings. Here's how I tackled it, and the insights I gained along the way.

#### Snapshotting the Containers Filesystem

My journey began with creating a snapshot of the Docker container's filesystem. This step was essential to encapsulate the exact state of the OpenVAS instance at that moment. Using the `docker export `command, I generated a tarball of the container's filesystem:

`docker export -o openvas_snapshot.tar openvas_on_azure`

#### Docker Image and Volume Configuration

The next challenge involved dealing with Docker images and volumes. My OpenVAS container utilized a volume to persist data across sessions. To migrate both the container and its data, I needed to create a backup of the volume's content. This was accomplished by creating a new Docker container (based on BusyBox or Ubuntu) and mounting the volume from the original OpenVAS container. The tar command came to the rescue:

`docker run --rm --volumes-from openvas_on_azure -v /openvas/openvas_backup:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /data`


#### Preparing for the Move
With the snapshots in hand, the next step was transferring them to the target host. I used tools like SCP or WinSCP to move the container snapshot (openvas_snapshot.tar) and the volume backup (backup.tar) to the destination.

#### Creating a New Docker Image
To set up the OpenVAS instance on the new host, I started by importing the container snapshot as a new Docker image:
`docker import openvas_snapshot.tar openvas_new_image_name`

#### Restoring the Data Volume
However, the journey wasn't complete without migrating the data volume. On the destination host, I recreated the volume structure and content by first running a container and then extracting the data:

`docker run -v /data/openvas_data:/data --name dbstore2 ubuntu`

`docker run --rm --volumes-from dbstore2 -v /data/openvas_backup:/backup ubuntu sh -c "cd /dbdata && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"`

#### Bringing it All Together
With both the Docker image and the data volume in place, I initiated the OpenVAS Docker container on the new host. I used the same command I had used on the old host, but replaced the old image name with the new one. By maintaining a consistent directory structure, I sidestepped potential complications during the migration.

#### Reflections and Lessons

Migrating the OpenVAS instance provided invaluable insights into Docker, container volumes, and cross-environment deployments. The process underscored the importance of encapsulating application states, handling volumes, and maintaining consistent directory structures. While challenges arose due to network restrictions and differing environments, the experience highlighted the versatility and resilience of Docker as a deployment solution.

In the end, the successful migration of the OpenVAS installation showcased the power of containerization and the skills required to navigate the intricacies of the ever-changing tech landscape.
